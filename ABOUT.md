DeSent is designed as a decentralized, privacy-focused text messaging service, leveraging NGROK tunneling, onion routing, and public indexing to enable secure, global communication. Here’s a breakdown of how these features come together to create a secure and resilient messaging network:
# Decentralized Messaging with NGROK Tunneling (NOT ADDED)
DeSent’s core functionality allows users to host their own messaging servers, effectively decentralizing control and providing multiple points of access for users worldwide. NGROK is used to tunnel through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and securely open ports from Local Area Networks (LAN) to Wide Area Networks (WAN), making each server accessible without the need to directly modify network settings. This approach enables individuals to establish a secure endpoint for communication, bypassing traditional barriers like closed ports and NAT (Network Address Translation) restrictions that would otherwise hinder peer-to-peer connections.
Onion Network for Anonymity and Security
As DeSent expands with more servers, it plans to implement an onion network architecture. This means that each connection will be routed through a series of nodes before reaching its final destination, with each layer of the connection encrypted and decrypted in steps. This “multi-layer encryption” process ensures that no single node can fully trace the origin and destination of the communication. Users enjoy enhanced anonymity, as each node only knows the immediate previous and next “hops” in the route.
By adopting an onion routing structure, DeSent prevents any single server or intermediary from identifying the message’s source or final recipient. Only the last server, which decrypts the final layer, can deliver the message to the intended recipient. The onion routing method builds a highly secure, distributed web of connections, suitable for sensitive communications and especially valuable in regions with censorship or heavy surveillance.

# Public Server Indexing System (IN TESTING)
To facilitate easy access to servers and allow users to quickly find popular or available connections, DeSent includes an indexing website. Each server that chooses to be publicly listed will appear in the index with a unique name and corresponding NGROK identifier. For example, an entry might appear as:
    Will’s Server: b1ac-216-126-34-147
This alphanumeric identifier serves as the NGROK tunnel address, allowing users to join specific servers through their indexed NGROK strings. The indexing system provides an organized way for users to search and discover servers, view server popularity, and even replace or update servers as needed. This mitigates the risk of “losing” popular or valuable servers, as users can always find other active servers in the index, ensuring continuity and resilience in the network. (edited)
